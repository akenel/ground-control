"""TIG · Tempest — what build is actually running?

Reads build-sha.txt (stamped by the deploy tooling at deploy time):
  line 1: short git SHA
  line 2: build date (human)
  line 3: commit count  -> version "bNNN"
If the file is absent (never deployed), everything reads "dev" — honestly.

Copied verbatim from the freehold reference app so /version behaves identically
across both projects (and the same deploy stamp works later).
